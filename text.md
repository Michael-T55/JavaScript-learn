   - Practice: [DOM Manipulation and Objects - Scrimba Interactive Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/dommanipulation)

### **Week 4: Advanced JavaScript Concepts**
**Goal:** Get familiar with more advanced topics like scope, closures, and ES6 features.

1. **Topics:**
   - Scope and Closures
   - ES6 Features (let, const, arrow functions, template literals)
   - Spread and Rest operators
   - Destructuring

2. **Resources:**

   - Practice: [JavaScript ES6 on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/)

### **Week 5: Asynchronous JavaScript**
**Goal:** Understand asynchronous JavaScript concepts like promises, async/await, and working with APIs.

1. **Topics:**
   - Callbacks
   - Promises
   - Async/Await
   - Fetch API for making network requests

2. **Resources:**
   - [JavaScript Promises Crash Course - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHvZLI7Db8E)

   - Practice: [Asynchronous JavaScript - Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript)

### **Week 6: Build Projects and Final Review**
**Goal:** Put everything youâ€™ve learned into practice by building small projects.

1. **Projects:**
   - To-Do List Application (DOM manipulation, events)
   - Fetching data from a public API (asynchronous code, promises)
   - A simple game or interactive website (combine functions, DOM, and objects)

2. **Resources:**
   - [JavaScript Project Ideas for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)
   - [How to Build a To-Do App - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ)

### **Additional Tips:**
- **Practice consistently**: Dedicate at least 1-2 hours daily to coding and review what you've learned.
- **Use developer tools**: Get familiar with Chrome DevTools for debugging and inspecting elements.

This plan provides a well-rounded foundation in JavaScript. After six weeks, you'll have the skills to build basic projects and continue exploring more advanced topics or frameworks like React.
